## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to enhance materials science education by providing interactive 3D visualizations of crystal structures and material properties.

## Motivation

Traditional materials science education often relies on 2D diagrams and static models to represent complex 3D crystal structures. This limitation makes it challenging for students to fully comprehend the spatial relationships and properties of materials. Our AR application addresses this gap by providing immersive, interactive learning experiences.

## Technical Implementation

- **Database**: SQLite for material property storage

### Key Features

1. **Interactive Crystal Structures**
   - Real-time manipulation of 3D crystal lattices
   - Zooming and rotation capabilities
   - Layer-by-layer visualization

2. **Property Visualization**
   - Color-coded property mapping
   - Interactive property sliders
   - Comparative analysis tools

3. **Educational Content**
